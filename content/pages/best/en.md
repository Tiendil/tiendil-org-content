I write about many topics, but I mostly focus on:

- [thinking]{tags:thinking}
- [game development]{tags:gamedev}
- [development in general]{tags:development}
- [books]{tags:books}

All essays are thematically divided into [theory]{tags:theory} and [practice]{tags:practice}.

You can find the tag filter on the [main page]{absolute:/en/}.

On this page, I’ve gathered links to the most interesting texts on key topics, arranged from new to early.

Here is a detailed post [about the blog]{post:@choose-nearest-language:about-blog}.

The most interesting posts are highlighted in bold.

You may also be interested in visiting the [Russian version of the blog]{absolute:/ru/posts/best}. It contains much more content, as I’ve been blogging in Russian since 2013 and only started writing bilingual posts in 2024. Over time, I plan to translate all my posts into English, but this requires a lot of time and effort.
