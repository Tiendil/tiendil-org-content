I write about many things, but mostly focused on:

- [thinking]{tags:thinking}
- [game development]{tags:gamedev}
- [development in general]{tags:development}
- [books]{tags:books}

All essays are divided thematically into [theory]{tags:theory} and [practice]{tags:practice}.

The tag filter can be found on the [main page]{absolute:/en/}.

On this page I've gathered links to the most interesting texts on key topics from new to early.

Here is a detailed post [about the blog]{post:@choose-nearest-language:about-blog}.

**The most interesting is highlighted in bold.**

Also, you may be interested in visiting the [Russian version of the blog]{absolute:/ru/posts/best}. It contains much more content: I blog in Russian since 2013 and started write bilingual posts only in 2024. With time, I will translate all of my posts to English, but it requires a lot of time and effort.
