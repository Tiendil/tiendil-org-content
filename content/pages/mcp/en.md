This blog has its own MCP ([Model Context Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Context_Protocol)) server that you can hook up to your favorite AI system to make reading my posts easier for both you and it.

MCP server address: https://tiendil.org/mcp/

The server is running in an experimental mode, I'd appreciate any feedback or suggestions for improvement.

Here's a short visual guide on how to connect an MCP server to ChatGPT: [guide](https://www.stephenwthomas.com/azure-integration-thoughts/how-to-enable-remote-mcp-servers-in-chatgpt-step-by-step-tutorial/).
