I have been involved in various activities besides programming, so I position myself not as a programmer, but as a software developer.

With a good quality I can write code, develop architecture, design user interfaces, handle deployment, testing, documentation writing, lead, gather/write/discuss requirements, write technical specifications, etc.

I believe that a developer should do whatever is most necessary for the project at the moment, regardless of the type of activity.

I possess a rare and epic skill of programming without external QA. I instill corresponding practices around me.

I enjoy answering well-posed questions.
