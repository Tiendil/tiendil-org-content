Recently I unexpectedly encountered a working justice system in the USA, and I did almost nothing for it.

- In 2017-2018, when there was a crypto and bitcoin boom, I invested a little in a mining startup: purchased their tokens and one unit of hardware.
- The startup went up, began to build a mega farm, but it didn't work out — the fall of bitcoin coincided with their spending peak, the money ran out, and the company went bankrupt. It's funny that a month or two after filing for bankruptcy, bitcoin played back everything. Sometimes you're just unlucky :-)
- I scored on the lost money, of course. I acted on the rule "invest only 10% of the income that you don't mind losing."
- Since everything legally happened in the USA, people gathered there and filed a class action lawsuit.
- I received a letter that I was automatically among the plaintiffs if I did not refuse. I did not refuse, when else would I get such an opportunity.
- Everything calmed down until 2024.
- In the spring, another letter came: "confirm the ownership of the tokens and indicate their quantity, we won and will share the remainings among all token holders proportionally, minus a healthy commission to the lawyers."
- But how do I confirm? More than 5 years have passed. The account in the Belarusian bank is closed, the company's admin panel is unavailable, there was no direct transaction in the blockchain — I paied in bitcoin directly from some exchange (although it is not recommended to do so).
- I found an email from the company about how many tokens I bought, printed it to pdf. Attached it to the application with screenshots of the transactions from the exchange for related period. Gave the address of my current wallet where these tokens lie dead weight. Sent everything.
- Today, I received $700 on my bank account. This is, of course, not all the lost money, but 25% will be, maybe even more.

What conclusions can be drawn from this:

- Sometimes you just don't get lucky in your business.
- Keep all emails, you never know what and when will come in handy.
- Class action lawsuits work and do it in an interesting way.
- Justice in the USA works slowly, but, apparently, inevitably and unexpectedly loyally to minor participants in the conflict. At least sometimes.
