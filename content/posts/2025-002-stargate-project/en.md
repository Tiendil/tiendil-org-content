In January, there was a lot of talk about the [Stargate Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_LLC) — the U.S. initiative to develop AI with a budget of $0.5 billion. In terms of investment, it is comparable to the [Manhattan Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project) (creating the atomic bomb) and the [Apollo Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program) (the first humans on the Moon).

Stargate is an interesting and undoubtedly important project for humanity, and it will most likely lead to significant results. But let's not be overly optimistic about it.

Historical examples show that projects of this scale impact ordinary people's lives indirectly and only after decades.

The Manhattan Project created the atomic bomb, but [Mechs with atomic reactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecha) did not start guarding borders, and atomic battery-powered cars did not appear on the roads.

Apollo sent people to the Moon, but space hotels did not open, and even visiting the Moon turned out to be a temporary activity.

So, why are these projects important?

<!-- more -->

They brought together people who built companies and environments, where a new generation of engineers and entrepreneurs emerged — who, in turn, built companies and environments, which laid the foundation for modern technology and gave rise to even more companies and environments…

I can't say for sure how many generations it took for the average person to feel the impact of Manhattan and Apollo, but it was definitely more than one.

Things are happening faster now, and Stargate will bear fruit faster, but not instantaneously and not in the next few years.

To reap the benefits of Stargate now, you need to be involved — helping "put the budget to good use" :-)

That's why I would expect real changes in our lives (specifically from the Stargate project) in about 5-10 years. For now, though, for most of us, all the news about Stargate will feel more like intriguing tidbits from a parallel universe rather than something we can actually experience.
