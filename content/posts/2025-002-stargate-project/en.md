In January, there was a lot of talk about the [Stargate project](https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/) — the U.S. initiative to develop AI with a budget of $0.5 billion. In terms of investment, it is comparable to the [Manhattan project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project) (creating the atomic bomb) and the [Apollo program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program) (the first humans on the Moon).

Stargate is an interesting and undoubtedly important project for humanity, and it will most likely lead to cool results. But let's not be overly optimistic about it.

Examples from history show that projects like this one affect the lives of ordinary people indirectly and only after decades.

Manhattan created the atomic bomb, but [Mechs with atomic reactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mech_(mecha)) did not start guarding borders, and atomic battery-powered cars did not appear on the roads.

Apollo sent people to the Moon, but space hotels did not open, and even visiting the Moon turned out to be a temporary activity.

What these projects really did was bring together people who organized companies and environment where a new generation of engineers and entrepreneurs grew up, who organized companies and environment, which laid the foundation of modern technologies and gave birth to new companies and environment…

I can't say for certain how many generations it took for the average person to feel the impact of Manhattan and Apollo, but it definitely more than one.

Things are happening faster now, and Stargate will bear fruits faster, but not instantaneously and not in the next years.

To reap the benefits of Stargate now, you need to be involved making sure the budgets get spent :-)

That's why I would expect real changes in our lives (specifically from the Stargate project) in about 5-10 years. For now, though, for most of us, all the news about Stargate will feel more like intriguing tidbits from a parallel universe rather than something we can actually experience.
