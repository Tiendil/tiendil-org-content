In January, there was a lot of talk about the [Stargate Project](https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/) — the U.S. initiative to develop AI with a budget of $0.5 billion. In terms of investment, it is comparable to the [Manhattan Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project) (creating the atomic bomb) and the [Apollo Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program) (the first humans on the Moon).

Stargate is an interesting and undoubtedly important project for humanity, and it will most likely lead to cool results. But let's not be overly optimistic about it.

Historical examples show that projects like this affect ordinary people's lives indirectly and only after decades.

Manhattan created the atomic bomb, but [Mechs with atomic reactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mech_(mecha)) did not start guarding borders, and atomic battery-powered cars did not appear on the roads.

Apollo sent people to the Moon, but space hotels did not open, and even visiting the Moon turned out to be a temporary activity.

So, why are these projects important?

They bring together people who organized companies and the environment where a new generation of engineers and entrepreneurs grew up, who organized companies and the environment, which laid the foundation of modern technologies and gave birth to new companies and the environment…

I can't say for sure how many generations it took for the average person to feel the impact of Manhattan and Apollo, but it was definitely more than one.

Things are happening faster now, and Stargate will bear fruits faster, but not instantaneously and not in the following years.

To reap the benefits of Stargate now, you need to be involved and make sure the budgets get spent :-)

That's why I would expect real changes in our lives (specifically from the Stargate project) in about 5-10 years. For now, though, for most of us, all the news about Stargate will feel more like intriguing tidbits from a parallel universe rather than something we can actually experience.
