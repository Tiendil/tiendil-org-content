### Modern News Agency strategy game

Hi, friends!

I'm working on a game about a modern news agency where you play as the chief editor in a megalopolis full of paranormal activities and low-grade heroes. And I need your help ;-)

To make the game better and more interesting, I want to know a little about you — the players, and your preferences.

I will be grateful if you could spare 10-15 minutes to complete this survey. Your answers will be a great help for me.

Cleaned, anonymized results will be published in [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Tiendil/world-builders-2023).

Thank you for your time and support!

### Section 3: I am the chief editor

Hooray!

You finished the boring part. Let's start the fun one.

I have a few questions about the core concepts of the game that I'm not sure about. I will greatly appreciate your answers.

Let me add some context for you:

- Our times plus 5-10 years.
- The world is one leg in singularity and another in paranormal phenomena of different kinds.
- You are the chief editor of a news agency in a metropolis.
- You decide what news to publish and how to publish them.
- You decide what news to investigate and how to investigate them.
- You decide where to assign your journalists and which risk to take.
- You manage relations with the pillars of power and with the public.
- And, of course, your decisions should change society. What is the point of being the chief editor otherwise?

#### Our world has become dynamic

In the old times, if you were to release a newspaper, you only release a newspaper. In our times, you should publish news in chats, tweet about them, record TikToks, make videos on YouTube, and so on.

For a game about a news agency to be believable, how is it essential to allow more than a single channel of news distribution?

[linear scale  1..10]

Not important at all <-> Absolutely important

- distribute news with magic creatures, aka "news fairies"
- other: [your variant]

#### How realistic should be shown the work of news agencies and journalists? Including all nuances.

[linear scale  1..10]

simplified fairy tale <-> gray morality in all its greatness

#### How many concurrent news agencies should be in the game?

- Other: [your variant]

[radioboxes, choose 1]

- up to 25 workers
- up to 50 workers
- up to 100 workers
- I'll build a bureaucratic empire!
- Other: [your variant]

#### How much effort do you want to put into managing the budget of your news agency?

[linear scale  1..10]

I prefer focusing on other things <-> Where is my grossbook?

#### How much effort do you want to put into managing relationships between the agency and everyone outside?

I'm not interested in this <-> There is nothing better than good intrigue
