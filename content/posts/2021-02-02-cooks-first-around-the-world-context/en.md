This is the second book by Ha-Joon Chang that I've read. The first one, [Bad Samaritans]{post:choose-nearest-language:evil-samaritans}, left a good impression, and it was also positively reviewed by [Tim O'Reilly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_O'Reilly) in his book [WTF?]{post:choose-nearest-language:about-book-wtf}. So "Economics: The User's Guide" appeared on my reading list and I finally got to it.

_*Here and futher, all quotes point to Russian edition of the book and are translated to English by me => inconsistencies are possible.*_

According to Chang, the book was conceived as an _"introduction to economic theory for the widest possible audience"_ (page 299) and this is well reflect its essence. I would only add, from the perspective of my post-soviet education, that the book looks more like an "overview of the diversity and complexity of economics, diluted with an introduction to theory" rather than an "introduction to theory".

The book contains no mathematical formulas or jaw-dropping statistics, just concrete facts. What makes it interesting, however, is a set of prisms through which you can — and should — view the economy to gain a basic understanding of what's happening around you.

Chan gives a set of points of view through which you can look at economic processes, describes their advantages and disadvantages, accompanies all this with examples, historical references, and facts.

Since the book is a kind of textbook, I will not try to retell it — this would lead to an attempt to repeat the book in a couple of pages, and I definitely can't do that. I will limit myself to describing the author's view of the economy in the whole, as I understood it.

## Nuances of presenting the material

The book was published in 2015 — almost 10 years ago. From that moment, life has significantly shaken humanity, so don't forget to place all facts and statements in the context of the mid-tens.

The author definitely has his own view of things, his own ideology. From my perspective, "Economics: The User's Guide" does not look like a manifesto of these ideas. Unless you consider as a manifesto an advocacy for a critical view of things, rational thinking, and common sense.

In the book, Ha-Joon Chang:

- Advises to study various types of economic judgments, develop critical thinking, and choose an approach/theory/model suitable for concrete circumstances.
- Tries to explore a wide range of countries, each differing in various parameters, to avoid biases akin to the [WEIRD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology#WEIRD_bias) phenomenon in psychology.
- Constantly criticizes opinions like "there is only one right approach to …".

The author clearly states that he tried to convey the full range of opinions without polarization. I think he succeeded. But I have my own perspective, you have yours. Don't forget that the book reflects the author's opinion, and the essay is my personal perception of it.

## Structure of the book

"Economics: The User's Guide" consists of two parts.

The first part provides a historical background, describes the most influential economic schools, and introduces basic concepts.

In the second part, the author examines specific prisms through which you can look at the economy and related concepts, such as [GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product), [derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(finance)), [investments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment), etc.

In the final part, there is a brief summary of Chang's view of the economy. I'll try to retell it in my own words.

## Economy is inseparable from politics

Chang says he wanted to show _"how to think about economics, not what to think"_ (page 293).

He denies economic theories objective scientific truth and, consequently, denies economics the status of science.

> Economic theory has always been and remains part of politics. It has never been — and will not become — a science, because there are no objective truths in economics that can be established independently of political, and often ethical, judgments.
>
> page 293 "Economics: The User's Guide", Ha-Joon Chang

This is a bit strange, as earlier in the text the author calls economics a science.

In other words, our economic decisions are always influenced not only by the "objective reality" but also by our subjective views of what is right and what is wrong.

For example, there is no scientific list of what should and should not be sold on the market. This list changes throughout human history depending on our specific needs and core values.

Economic decisions not only depend on politics but also change it. Exaggerating, if you can bring some stuff (like water, people, health, child labor) to the market, you increase the influence of the rich people on it (the "one dollar — one vote" rule starts to work) and reduce the influence of the "powerful" people. If you remove stuff from the market, then power is redistributed in the opposite direction (the "one person — one vote" rule starts to work, in the case of democracy).

By the way, MMO developers constantly face similar dilemmas. In particular, I often thought about it while working on [The Tale](https://the-tale.org).

Also, if you look at the measuring part of the economy, you can see that the actual numbers are based on ethically/politically biased theories, shaky definitions, and inaccurate data, therefore, always controversial. Answers to questions like "What to include in GDP calculation? What not to include? How exactly to calculate it?" are always subjective, politicized.

Such a position has interesting consequences.

Firstly, the author recommends not to trust any economist who claims that his analysis is scientific and free from evaluative judgments.

Secondly, _"Economics is too important to be left to professional economists"_ (page 294).

Chang says that everyone should be ready to challenge professional economists (including the author) because their arguments are mostly political, not objective/scientific. Economists do not (and should not) have a monopoly on truth.

The author goes even further and says that the willingness to challenge economists should be the basis of democracy. In the spirit of: we should not allow a _"bunch of self-proclaimed experts"_ (page 296) to govern our society.

Everyone should know and understand the diversity of economic theories to prevent their use as a political argument and effectively resist manipulation.

Thirdly, there is something useful in every economic theory. Instead of fanatically following one of them, it is necessary to choose wisely and critically how and through what we look at a specific issue in a specific context.

## My opinion

I have a dual attitude towards Chang's position.

On the one hand, I agree with him in general. I have written more than once that:

- [models of reality]{post:choose-nearest-language:life-and-work-with-models}, which are economic theories, are always limited, and they should be applied with the right context in mind.
- using [memeplexes]{post:genes-memes-memeplexes} as a strategy should be avoided in favor of the [composition]{post:composition-vs-classification} of atomic practices.

On the other hand, the position seems slightly radical and poorly aligned with the main text of the book (Chang formulated his view in the final chapter). Perhaps this is a translation defect, and  the author used softer statements.

I agree that the economy is inseparable from politics, but I do not understand why the study of some subjective thing cannot be considered science. Rather, we need to choose more appropriate tools for scientific research.

Also, I agree that the regulation of the economy should be democratic, but isn't it already (in developed countries)? After all, "economics professors" do not regulate the economy directly, this is done by elected representatives of the people, who, in turn, can choose whose economic advice to follow.

## Funny ideas and facts

The book contains many interesting historical facts. At some point, I stopped writing them down, noting only the most curious for me. Here are a few:

- From 1776 to 1980, the production of pins increased from 20 to 800,000 pins per day per worker.
- In 1804, the [acting Vice President of the United States killed the acting Minister of Finance in a duel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton-Burr_duel).
- By estimates, 30%-50% of international trade in industrial products is actually intra-firm trade or just the transfer of resources within one multinational or transnational corporation.
- The average holding period for shares decreased from 5 years in the 1960s to 2 years in the 1980s to 7.5 months in 2007.
- Deindustrialization does not mean a decrease in the volume of production. It's just that the cost of production is decreasing, and the cost of services is not.
- _"We have always lived in a knowledge economy. It has always been the quality of the knowledge used, not the physical nature of the products produced (whether material goods or non-material services), that made industrialized countries richer"_ (page 174). Technologies just become obsolete. For example, the production of woolen fabric in the mid-18th century was one of the most high-tech industries, and today it is one of the least high-tech.

## Some thoughts inspired by the book

### Derivatives

The mechanisms of trading derivatives are crazy and become even crazier. It is very similar to the case when mathematics and statistics are used as a [cargo cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult).

### Moving Away from Simplifying Production Operations

For a long time, there was a trend in production to simplify the worker's operations: from manufactories to conveyor belts, work became simpler and more monotonous

In my opinion, over the past 30-40 years, this trend has broken and is going back.

Resources and time spent on a detailed analysis and elaboration of production operations lead to a slowdown in the manufacturer's response to market changes. Your processes (and production, as a result) risk becoming obsolete before you optimize everything and put it on the shelves.

Therefore, the value of multifunctional professionals with a lot of skills, high learning ability, and independence is increasing. Such people, of course, are not able to super-optimize their work, but they can quickly bend it in any direction, no matter where the market wind blows.

With the explosive development of AI, this trend should become even more noticeable, as the focus of work will shift not from optimizing operations to optimizing processes, but from optimizing processes to optimizing ideas when the "average" worker will need to change not the company's processes but the product ideas.
