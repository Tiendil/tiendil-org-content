I continue developing my news reader: [feeds.fun](https://feeds.fun). To gather information and people together, I created several resources where you can discuss the project:

- Blog [blog.feeds.fun](https://blog.feeds.fun)
- [Discord server](https://discord.gg/C5RVusHQXy)
- Reddit [r/feedsfun](https://www.reddit.com/r/feedsfun/)

So far, there is no one and nothing there, but over time there will definitely be news and people.

If you are interested in this project, join! I'll be glad to see you and will try to respond quickly to all questions.
