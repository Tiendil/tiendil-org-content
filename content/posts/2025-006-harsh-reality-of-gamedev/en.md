Creative Director of Moon Studios (developer of [Ori](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1057090/Ori_and_the_Will_of_the_Wisps/)) [shared on X (Twitter)](https://x.com/thomasmahler/status/1928902673459511710) some "sad" statistics about the income from the successfull first game of anonymous developers (not specified who). The tweet is [discussed on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieDev/comments/1l08267/how_selling_2_million_copies_of_your_game_can/). I will summarize it briefly and add a lot of my own thoughts.

/// note | Original money breakdown

- 2 million copies sold on Steam.
- Development cost — $10M, funded by the publisher.
- Publisher also spent $2M on marketing (total $12M).
- Game priced at $20, but with discounts (Steam reality), the average price is around $10.
- Total revenue from sales was $20M.
- After deducting Steam fees (30%), $14M remains.
- Publisher, exercising their preferential right, takes the first $12M to cover costs.
- The remaining $2M is split according to the agreement 70/30 in favor of the publisher.
- Developers receive $600K.
- After deducting the cost of tools (~$15K) and taxes (around 50%), approximately $292,500 remains.

As a result:

- From a very successful game, the developer receives about 2.9% of the revenue.
- The developer still has no money for the next game.
- De-facto, the developer is left with a small safety cushion for a rainy day.

So, that's how it turns out…

We can look at this situation from a lot of different angles. There are many nuances, as they say. No single point of view will reveal the whole truth, but if we gather them together, we can get a more or less complete picture.

/// note | About which game do we speak?

Thomas Mahler, the source of the statistics, did not specify which game the data is from. ChatGPT assumes it refers to the first Ori game, but this is speculative.

Because the author of the post did not specify the original game, I discuss the whole situation abstractly and mention Ori only as an example in some places.

## Everything is really bad in gamedev

To earn money you need to make a very successful game. A lot (most?) of PC games do not break even; just good games have a zero balance.

Gamedev, still, is not a free pirate sailing — it's a complex expedition on someone else's money. If you are an extremely charismatic and lucky pirate, you will have some freedom of action, but usually you serve the interests of capital owners or the mass market of players.

The only true freedom in gamedev is independent **author's** projects, which are often developed as a hobby.

## A "predatory" (?) publishing deal

Based on the numbers, the agreement with the publisher was not in the favor of the developers. I called it predatory for dramatic effect (it may be ok), but these terms are somewhere in the lower third of the market (as I saw it a year ago when studying such practices for [world builders]{tags:world-builders}).

70/30 with no bonuses for meeting metrics (for delivering on time, within budget, good rating, selling over a million) is quite greedy for a contract with people who can make a game with millions of copies sold. They may have been complete nonames at the time of signing the contract, but still.

## Mistakes may be made in planning?

/// note | Can mistakes be avoided?

The most important thing to remember is that [everyone makes mistakes]{post:life-and-work-with-mistakes}. Creating a large product without making mistakes is almost impossible.

**The success of a product indicates that developers made significantly fewer mistakes than correct decisions.**

Therefore, even if places where I would point out are really mistakes, it is far from certain that fixing them would have been beneficial. Such maneuvers are limited by time, and we always have to choose where to direct our efforts and what directions keep untouched.

**If we do one thing well, something else will be done poorly.**
///

### Mistake 1: Too low price?

Let's recalculate the numbers based on a price of $25 (+$5):

- 2 million copies sold on Steam.
- Development cost — $10M, funded by the publisher.
- Publisher also spent $2M on marketing (total $12M).
- **Game sold at $25, but with discounts (Steam reality), the average price is around $12.5.**
- Total revenue from sales was $25M.
- After deducting Steam fees (30%), $17.5M remains.
- Publisher, exercising their preferential right, takes the first $12M to cover costs.
- **Remaining $5.5M** (instead of $2M) is split according to the agreement 70/30 in favor of the publisher.
- Developers receive $1.65M.
- After deducting the cost of tools (~$15K) and taxes (around 50%), approximately $817,500 remains (instead of $292,500).

We can see that **by increasing the price by $5, the developer could have earned 2.8 times more money**.

Of course, by increasing the price we can not guarantee the same sales volume, but in the case of a very high-quality and successful game, in my opinion, the drop would be significantly less than the price increase.

Event on the example of Ori, we can see that the first version of the game was sold for $20, and the second for $30 — the developers drew conclusions.

### Mistake 2: Something with taxes?

50% taxes for the company look like a lot. In many countries, even if you withdraw money from the company, the tax is progressive and it is not a fact that it will reach 50% from the all income.

I would recommend to consult with tax advisors in such cases.

Generally, if you have a budget of $10M, it makes sense to consult tax advisors and lawyers **before** spending that money. There is a chance that the right records in documents and invoices can help save on taxes and ultimately get more money.

## Hidden profit

This is the most interesting part, and what was clearly omitted from the original post.

### Releases on other platforms

Successful games are must-to-release on other platforms. Often such work even can be outsourced. Releasing on consoles like Nintendo Switch, Xbox, PlayStation can significantly increase revenues.

### Related products

Successful game ~~not always but~~ often means a successful intellectual property. This means that various products can be released based on it.

For example, fast googling shows that Ori had plush toys released.

Besides toys, there are books, t-shirts, stickers — anything you can think of.

There not a lot of money in such products, but they can be autsourced to third-party companies, — take care of the pennies, and the pounds will take care of themselves.

### Sallaries of developers

The lack of salaries were not mentioned in the original post, so it is resonable to assume that all developers, including the founders of the company, were paid. Maybe not as much as they should be, but in a way that allowed them to live and maybe even save some money.

I.e. the mentioned final income is a company's money, not the developers' money — developers' sallaries are in $10M development cost.

### The mature company and team

**The most important and valuable!**

The organizers of this whole enterprise gained experience, connections, a team, and a company.

De-facto, the money from the publishers was used to create a company, gather an experienced team that has proven in practice that it can make successful games. Work processes were established, many everyday gamedev routine issues were resolved. Event CI/CD, I believe, were set up.

The company and the team are an epic asset that cannot be ignored:

- The next publishing deal will be more favorable.
- The next game will be made faster and with higher quality.
- The company has a good intellectual property that can be used in the future.
- The company has a fanbase that can be a good support in marketing.

## Play the long game

Here is my personal beliefs.

If you place money ahead of self-realization / bringing value to people — do not go into gamedev. There are simpler ways to make big money. You will do good both to yourself and to the people who won't have to play your junk.

If your goal is to realize yourself through the finished product — do not go into big projects, do not start them on someone else's money. Money and the mass market impose severe [restrictions on creative freedom]{post:one-form-two-products} — you will either have to step over yourself or go bankrupt.

/// note | What is a "big project"?
It depends, as people say.

I my current worldview, the calculations from the original tweet are somewhere between a medium and a large project, but leaning towards large.

When I calculated the [educational business plan for World Builders]{post:world-builders-2023-business-plan-example}, I came up with about $6M costs for two years of development until the final release. I consider that project fairly average.

Note, if you do not pay yourself a salary, it does not mean you save the budget. It means you are borrowing from yourself — you will have to pay it back. Accordingly, if we take the average planetary salary of a good developer at $100K per year, then a team of 5 enthusiasts for 2 years is already $1M. Even if you're working nights and weekends — you're straight-up devouring your own time — trust me, I'm an expert at this :-D

Большинство больших дорогих проектов — жвачка. Как и большинство таких же фильмов.

Крупные проекты в геймдеве хороши для узких специалистов. Если вам нравиться делать самые крутые шейдеры, или рисовать самых волосатых NPC, или писать диалоги которые игроки читают на 2% глубже, чем у конкурентов — тогда вам в AAA. Но учтите, что суммарно ваш проект будет [жвачкой с большим рейтингом]{post:rpg-of-winning-marketing}.

И это возможно только если вы уже крутой специалист. В противном случае вы окажетесь на конвейере с однотипными задачами, которые ещё и не дадут вам развиваться.

И даже если вы крутой спец, не всё может быть так гладко. Вы давно видели крышесносный ИИ в ААА играх? Или историю, которая прям тянет за душу? В АА я видел, в А видел, в ААА — нет. А ведь есть профи, которые хотели бы это делать (даже я хотел в игровой ИИ идти, но стрела в колено попала), вот только в ААА бюджет выделяют не на это, поэтому что массовый рынок это не ценит.

Что же делать?

Не гнаться за миллионами, не играть в лотерею.

Вместо этого надо поступательно строить устойчивый бизнес. От малого к большему: строить небольшую команду, которая делает небольшие, но добротные игры, собирать сообщество вокруг себя, расти поступательно, поступательно увеличивать масштабы и сложность проектов.

Это тоже непросто, эмоционально даже сложнее. Но именно этот подход, в теории, даст вам ту свободу и пространство для манёвра, на отсутствие которых жалуется автор оригинального поста.

И, что самое забавное, команда из расчётов, скорее всего, так и делает. И, скорее всего, у них всё хорошо — поступательно растут, получают больше свободы с каждым разом.

Возможно, им не стоило так высоко замахиваться с первой игрой и расчёты были бы приятнее. С другой стороны, они рискнули, замахнулись и выиграли — победителей не судят :-)
