Creative Director of Moon Studios (developer of [Ori](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1057090/Ori_and_the_Will_of_the_Wisps/)) [shared on X (Twitter)](https://x.com/thomasmahler/status/1928902673459511710) some "sad" statistics about the income from the successful first game of anonymous developers (not specified who). The tweet is [discussed on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieDev/comments/1l08267/how_selling_2_million_copies_of_your_game_can/).

This sparked a lot of thoughts, and I’m going to share every single one of them with you — whether you like it or not :-)

/// note | Original money breakdown

- 2 million copies sold on Steam.
- Development cost — $10M, funded by the publisher.
- The publisher also spent $2M on marketing ($12M total).
- The game is priced at $20, but with discounts (such is Steam reality), the average price is around $10.
- Game priced at $20, but with discounts (Steam reality), the average price is around $10.
- Total revenue from sales was $20M.
- After deducting Steam fees (30%), $14M remains.
- Publisher, exercising their preferential right, takes the first $12M to cover costs.
- The remaining $2M is split according to the agreement 70/30 in favor of the publisher.
- Developers receive $600K.
- After deducting the cost of tools (~$15K) and taxes (around 50%), approximately $292,500 remains.

As a result:

- The developer still has no money for the next game, which will cost the same $10M.
- De facto, the developer is left with a small safety cushion for a rainy day.

So, that's how it turns out…

We can look at this situation from a lot of different angles. There are many nuances, as they say. No single point of view will reveal the whole truth, but if we gather them together, we can get a more or less complete picture.

/// note | About which game do we speak?

Thomas Mahler, the source of the statistics, did not specify which game the data is from. ChatGPT assumes it refers to the first Ori game, but this is speculative.

Since the author of the post did not specify the original game, I discuss the entire situation abstractly and mention Ori only as an example in some places.

## Everything is really bad in gamedev

To earn money you need to make a very successful game. A lot (most?) of PC games do not break even; just good games have a zero balance.

Gamedev, still, is not a free pirate sailing — it's a complex expedition on someone else's money. If you are an extremely charismatic and lucky pirate, you will have some freedom of action, but usually you serve the interests of capital owners or the mass market of players.

The only true freedom in gamedev is independent **author's** projects, which are often developed as a hobby.

## A "predatory" (?) publishing deal

Based on the numbers, the agreement with the publisher was not in the favor of the developers. I called it predatory for dramatic effect (it may be ok), but these terms are somewhere in the lower third of the market (as I saw it a year ago when studying such practices for [world builders]{tags:world-builders}).

70/30 with no bonuses for meeting metrics (for delivering on time, within budget, good rating, selling over a million) is quite greedy for a contract with people who can make a game with millions of copies sold. They may have been complete nonames at the time of signing the contract, but still.

## Mistakes may be made in planning?

/// note | Can mistakes be avoided?

The most important thing to remember is that [everyone makes mistakes]{post:life-and-work-with-mistakes}. Creating a large product without making mistakes is almost impossible.

**The success of a product indicates that developers made significantly fewer mistakes than correct decisions.**

Therefore, even if places where I would point out are really mistakes, it is far from certain that fixing them would have been beneficial. Such maneuvers are limited by time, and we always have to choose where to direct our efforts and what directions keep untouched.

**If we do one thing well, something else will be done poorly.**
///

### Mistake 1: Too low price?

Let's recalculate the numbers based on a price of $25 (+$5):

- 2 million copies sold on Steam.
- Development cost — $10M, funded by the publisher.
- Publisher also spent $2M on marketing (total $12M).
- **Game sold at $25, but with discounts (Steam reality), the average price is around $12.5.**
- Total revenue from sales was $25M.
- After deducting Steam fees (30%), $17.5M remains.
- Publisher, exercising their preferential right, takes the first $12M to cover costs.
- **Remaining $5.5M** (instead of $2M) is split according to the agreement 70/30 in favor of the publisher.
- Developers receive $1.65M.
- After deducting the cost of tools (~$15K) and taxes (around 50%), approximately $817,500 remains (instead of $292,500).

We can see that **by increasing the price by $5, the developer could have earned 2.8 times more money**.

Of course, by increasing the price we can not guarantee the same sales volume, but in the case of a very high-quality and successful game, in my opinion, the drop would be significantly less than the price increase.

Event on the example of Ori, we can see that the first version of the game was sold for $20, and the second for $30 — the developers drew conclusions.

### Mistake 2: Something with taxes?

50% taxes for the company look like a lot. In many countries, even if you withdraw money from the company, the tax is progressive and it is not a fact that it will reach 50% from the all income.

I would recommend to consult with tax advisors in such cases.

Generally, if you have a budget of $10M, it makes sense to consult tax advisors and lawyers **before** spending that money. There is a chance that the right records in documents and invoices can help save on taxes and ultimately get more money.

## Hidden profit

This is the most interesting part, and what was clearly omitted from the original post.

### Releases on other platforms

Successful games are must-to-release on other platforms. Often such work even can be outsourced. Releasing on consoles like Nintendo Switch, Xbox, PlayStation can significantly increase revenues.

### Related products

Successful game ~~not always but~~ often means a successful intellectual property. This means that various products can be released based on it.

For example, fast googling shows that Ori had plush toys released.

Besides toys, there are books, t-shirts, stickers — anything you can think of.

There not a lot of money in such products, but they can be autsourced to third-party companies, — take care of the pennies, and the pounds will take care of themselves.

### Sallaries of developers

The lack of salaries were not mentioned in the original post, so it is resonable to assume that all developers, including the founders of the company, were paid. Maybe not as much as they should be, but in a way that allowed them to live and maybe even save some money.

I.e. the mentioned final income is a company's money, not the developers' money — developers' sallaries are in $10M development cost.

### The mature company and team

**The most important and valuable!**

The organizers of this whole enterprise gained experience, connections, a team, and a company.

De-facto, the money from the publishers was used to create a company, gather an experienced team that has proven in practice that it can make successful games. Work processes were established, many everyday gamedev routine issues were resolved. Event CI/CD, I believe, were set up.

The company and the team are an epic asset that cannot be ignored:

- The next publishing deal will be more favorable.
- The next game will be made faster and with higher quality.
- The company has a good intellectual property that can be used in the future.
- The company has a fanbase that can be a good support in marketing.

## Play the long game

Here is my personal beliefs.

If you place money ahead of self-realization / bringing value to people — do not go into gamedev. There are simpler ways to make big money. You will do good both to yourself and to the people who won't have to play your junk.

If your goal is to realize yourself through the finished product — do not go into big projects, do not start them on someone else's money. Money and the mass market impose severe [restrictions on creative freedom]{post:one-form-two-products} — you will either have to step over yourself or go bankrupt.

/// note | What is a "big project"?
It depends, as people say.

I my current worldview, the calculations from the original tweet are somewhere between a medium and a large project, but leaning towards large.

When I calculated the [educational business plan for World Builders]{post:world-builders-2023-business-plan-example}, I came up with about $6M costs for two years of development until the final release. I consider that project fairly average.

Note, if you do not pay yourself a salary, it does not mean you save the budget. It means you are borrowing from yourself — you will have to pay it back. Accordingly, if we take the average planetary salary of a good developer at $100K per year, then a team of 5 enthusiasts for 2 years is already $1M. Even if you're working nights and weekends — you're straight-up devouring your own time — trust me, I'm an expert at this :-D
///

Most big-budget projects are just chewing gum for the brain. Same goes for most blockbuster movies.

The large projects in gamedev are good for narrow seasoned specialists. If you like making the coolest shaders, or drawing the hairiest NPCs, or writing dialogues that players read 2% deeper than competitors' — then AAA is for you. But keep in mind that on average your project will be [chewing gum with a high rating]{post:rpg-of-winning-marketing}.

And it is possible only if you are already a skilled specialist. Otherwise, you will end up on a conveyor with monotonous tasks that won't let you grow.

And even if you are a skilled enough, not everything can go smoothly. Have you seen mind-blowing AI in AAA games? Or a story that really pulls at your heartstrings? I have seen it in AA, I have seen it in A, but not in AAA. And there are professionals who would like to do this (even I wanted to go into game AI, but I got an arrow in the knee), but AAA budgets are not allocated for this, because the mass market does not appreciate it.

So, what to do?

Do not chase millions, do not play the lottery.

Instead, build a sustainable business step by step. Start small: create a small team that makes small but solid games, gather a community around you, grow gradually, and increase the scale and complexity of your projects step by step.

This is also not easy, emotionally even harder. But this approach, in theory, will give you the freedom and space for maneuver that the author of the original post complains about.

And, what's most amusing, the team from the calculations probably does exactly that. And, most likely, they are doing well — steadily growing, gaining more freedom with each step.

Possibly, they should not have aimed so high with the first game, and the calculations would have been more pleasant, or not. They took a risk, aimed high, and won — no one judges the winners :-)

So, if you believe in yourself, believe you are winner, do what you believe in, what you think is right.
