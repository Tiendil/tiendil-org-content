Nice to meet you, friends!

My name is Aliaksei, but feel free to call me Tiendil â€” it is my nickname for the last 20 years or so :-)

A few words about me:

- By occupation, I am a software developer, mostly backend, mainly in Python.
- For most of my career, I worked in game development on big projects and own indie games.
- I like playing games, reading books, and writing long-reads about games, books, and thinking.

You can find more about me:

- In the [about page]{post:about}
- In my GitHub profile: [github.com/tiendil](https://github.com/Tiendil)
- In the LinkedIn profile: [linkedin.com/in/tiendil](https://linkedin.com/in/tiendil)

This is my first blog post in English, but not the first one in general. I have blogged in Russian for a long time and have always wanted to share my thoughts with the English-speaking world. At last, I found some time to adapt my blog, and here we are!

Most of the future posts will be bilingual (will be in two versions: in English and in Russian). Also, with time, I'll translate my most interesting old posts.

Once again, nice to meet you! Feel free to contact me by any means.
