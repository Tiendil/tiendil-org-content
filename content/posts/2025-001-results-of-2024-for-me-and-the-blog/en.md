Let me share what I was up to in 2024, how my plans for the outgoing year turned out, and what I plan for the year ahead.

## Blog

At the beginning of the year, I [moved the blog to a custom engine](post:@choose-nearest-language:blog-moved-to-brigid-engine) and I'm very happy with it. Of course, the [engine sources are open](https://github.com/Tiendil/brigid). [Post sources](https://github.com/Tiendil/tiendil-org-content) are open too and comfortably lie in GitHub, when I want to make a post, I create a branch and start writing.

The blog has become multilingual, with cool tag navigation, controlled suggestions for related posts, and clear SEO. There is still room for improvement, but nothing urgent. I am particularly proud that I managed to implement all of this in about a month, if not faster.

Thanks to multilingual support, I’ve started writing posts in both Russian and English (except for a few that didn’t make sense to translate).. For now, I write in Russian first and then translate into English. Maybe in the future I will switch the order.

It turned out that my Russian is quite difficult to translate idiomatically. I try to keep the language simple, but sayings and unique phrases still slip in. Sentence structure (and therefore the flow of thoughts) doesn’t transfer smoothly from Russian to English either. So, even though I've learned to write Russian posts faster, it still takes just as long to complete a post as before — 2-3 days.

Along with migrating to the new engine, I moved the blog to a new analytics system — [Plausible](https://plausible.io/). It requires a monthly subscription, but it doesn't leak data to corporations and anonymizes everything it can. So far, I'm happy with it.

### Blog statistics

I wrote 35 posts in the year — twice as many as the previous one. I'm on another subbatical, so it's understandable.

Dut to the migration to the new analytics system, it's hard to compare traffic with the previous year. Here's how it looks:

- The number of unique visitors per month from March to December doubled and exceeded 14k for the entire year. Hooray!
- Visitors to the English version made up a quarter of the Russian one or about 20% of the total.
- Visits from Google hovered around 500 per month.

The English version of the blog started from zero posts, so I think the results are pretty good. To be fair, I do occasionally promote the English posts (mostly on Reddit), while don't promote the Russian ones (I'm not sure where it would make sense to do so;  tried posting on Habr a couple of times, but the results weren’t great).

The number of subscribers in the [Russian Telegram](https://t.me/tiendil_org_ru) grew by 1.6 times and now stands at 93 people. The [Russian Discord](https://discord.gg/ZyNy28ZXM6) has 12 members. Unfortunately, the [English Telegram](https://t.me/tiendil_org_en) and [English Discord](https://discord.gg/2JNHAV7uMP) are still empty — I'll need to figure out what to do about that.

The English tops are similar, as I only translated one old post this year — and it’s leading in the overall top.

Special marketing and SEO achievements:

- [The post about Slay The Princess]{post:slay-the-princess-combinatoric-narrative} unexpectedly rose in Google search results and leads gamers to the blog. I'm not sure if they stay, but they read it for a while.
- The technical post about [migrating from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4.0]{post:migrating-from-gpt-3.5-turbo-to-gpt-4o-mini} still attracts interest, even though GPT-3.5 is no longer particularly relevant.
- A purely technical [post about migrating from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4.0]{post:migrating-from-gpt-3.5-turbo-to-gpt-4o-mini} is somehow still drawing interest, even though GPT-3.5 is hardly around anymore.
- [The post about a tricky SQL optimization]{post:fun-case-of-speeding-up-data-retrieval-with-psycopg} made it into the [PyCoders](https://pycoders.com/) newsletter. Well, I helped it get there :-)
- Analytics tracked 7 visits from AI services like ChatGPT and Perplexity.

**The top 10 countries by unique visitors**

Germany is so high because I'm the most active reader of this blog :-D

## Progress on plans

Regarding the plans from [last year’s review]{post:@choose-nearest-language:results-of-2023-for-me-and-the-blog}.

> Finish moving to Germany.

Done, this month I'm getting my resident permit in plastic.

> Resolve the majority of (accumulated) everyday issues.

My wife and I tackled them together. We got settled, and hopefully, we won’t have to move again for at least two years.

> Finish the [Product Vision Masters]{post:@choose-nearest-language:making-a-fictional-universe-month-1} training on a good note.

I finished with a [final presentation]{post:@choose-nearest-language:world-builders-2023-final-presentation}, [business plan]{post:world-builders-2023-business-plan-example}, and [technical prototype]{post:simulation-of-public-opinion-in-a-game}.

For now, all activities are on hold — the entire group of students is waiting while Mad Crusaders looks for funding and sorts out legal issues.

By the way, I recomend [the lectures from the second World Builders class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Td8_fEOQ8E4&list=PLsMUuz1UmdpmkXqvLR6RbnJL_gfPVYuE8). [Yarr Rash](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yarrrash/) has done a lot of work to formalize and compress the materials from last year — the lecture became more structured, understandable, and shorter. While last year’s lectures had more of an impromptu format, this year they actually feel like proper lectures.

> Try to promote [Feeds Fun]{post:@choose-nearest-language:feeds-fun-news-reader-with-tags-and-chatgpt}. Based on the results, decide on the project’s future.

Didn't have time last year, moving it to this one.

News feeds and tagging turned out to be much more complex than they appear at the first glance. Feeds Fun is actively evolving, but it’s still far from being user-friendly.

> Take a break/catch my breath.

I guess I rested a bit, but sometimes I doubt it :-)

> Return to reading and reviewing books.

Returned.

In 2024, I wrote 5 reviews:

- [Economics: the user's guide]{post:about-book-economics-the-users-guide}
- [The Net and the Butterfly]{post:about-book-the-net-and-the-butterfly}
- [Piranesi]{post:about-book-piranesi}
- [The Signal and the Noise]{post:review-of-the-signal-and-the-noise}
- [Harry Potter]{post:about-book-harry-potter}

Besides that, I read 5 good books on management and related topics, but decided not to review them separately, as it would easily take up to a month (considering my writing speed and my dislike for some management practices). Instead, I plan to write one big post reviewing all the books once I finish the entire list.

> Before looking for a job, try to launch at least one of my projects. Options: Feeds Fun, something from the Product Vision Masters, "The Tale 2.0", or something else.

In progress, postponed to this year.

> Migrate the blog to a new engine.

Done.

> Start fixing my English.

I started, but in a very basic way — using Duolingo, blogging in English, and reading English fiction and technical books. What I need most is to practice speaking, so I’m pushing this to next year.

> Start writing posts in English or translating existing ones.

Started writing, but didn’t have time to translate :-( Therefore, plans on translations are moved to this year.

> Find a job if my projects don’t work out.

I have some progress in my projects, so no job search yet. Postponed to this year.

> Develop my [exocortex]{tags:exocortex} by transitioning to personal instances of open-source software alternatives.

Aside from the blog, I haven’t migrated anything else. There’s just no time. For now, this activity is on hold.

> Fill the gaps in my management theory.

In the process, the reading plan is 50% complete. Moving to this year.

## Outside of the yearly plans

Some things weren’t planned, but happened.

### Stopped "The Tale"

It had been a long time coming, but I just couldn’t find time for it. By fall, "The Tale" had gotten to the point where operating it cost more than it was worth.

[The lore of the game]{post:@choose-nearest-language:the-tale-lore-cc-by} is now open for anyone to use.

### Returned to reading fiction

An unexpected and pleasant result for me.

I used to love reading fiction, but adult life after university took over, and I lost the time for it, with rare exceptions.

I managed to get back into reading by combining it with improving my English. Now I’m diving into English-language literature, something I’ve been wanting to do for a long time.

Turns out, reading in the evenings is a good replacement for games and TV shows. I thought it would require more brainpower, but no.

One fun discovery from the last year: I found Susanna Clarke’s vocabulary in [Piranesi]{post:about-book-piranesi} more familiar than J.K. Rowling’s in [Harry Potter]{post:about-book-harry-potter}.

For 2025, I’ve already ordered [Terry Pratchett’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett) [Witches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld_witches) series, and it should arrive soon. If I like it, I’ll dive into the entire Discworld series. :-D

### Open source

I released:

- [Brigid](https://github.com/Tiendil/brigid) — this blog engine.
- [Changy](https://github.com/Tiendil/changy) — a changelog manager for people.
- [Lore of The Tale game](https://the-tale.notion.site).

## Планы на следующий год

1. Определиться с будущим [Feeds Fun]{post:@choose-nearest-language:feeds-fun-news-reader-with-tags-and-chatgpt}: бизнес или хобби. Попиарить, собрать фидбек, пофиксить, попиарить ещё раз, сделать несколько таких циклов, принять решение.

2. Сделать MVP [игры]{post:simulation-of-public-opinion-in-a-game}, которую очертил на занятиях [World Builders]{tags:world-builders-2023}.

Вырисовывающиеся механики мне нравятся, надо довести эксперимент до логичного финала.

Попутно посмотрю две штуки, которые давно хотел попробовать:

- [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) как движок для инди игр.
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) как язык для реализации сложной логики. В моём случае это будет чистая игровая логика, где я надеюсь получить профит от параноидальной безопасности Rust. Если Rust не зайдёт, попробую [Zig](https://ziglang.org/).

3. Определиться будет какое-то финансовое взаимодействие с Mad Crusaders или нет.

4. Если продолжу сотрудничество с Mad Crusaders, то начать делать игру с ними на базе MVP.

5. Если не продолжу сотрудничество с Mad Crusaders И MVP будет играбельный И будет время, выпустить игру в Steam в виде авторской поделки от соло-разработчика.

6. Начать систематически тренировать разговорный английский.

7. Выучить 1000 новых английских слов. Художественная литература в помощь.

Не то, чтобы у меня скудный словарный запас, но Гарри Поттер показал, что в бытовой лексике у меня встречаются внезапные пробелы :-)

8. Перевести топ 10 русскоязычных постов на английский.

9. Закончить подтягивание менеджерских знаний.

- дочитать книги;
- сформировать своё видение управления проектом;
- подобрать аргументы под видение.

10. Слезть с колы и не подсесть на альтернативный кофеин.

Неожиданный пункт, но мы с женой тут посчитали, что за полгода я выпил колы почти на 1000 евро — в основном на бескофеиновую, но всё равно это не похоже на здоровое питание. Надо с этим завязывать.

11. Начать искать работу, если мои не выстрелят.
